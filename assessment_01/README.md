# Data Analytics Lab Assessment 01

## Question - 1

*Write Python code to perform document analysis and store the unique words in a vector in alphabetical order along with its frequency.*

## Question - 2

*Write Python code to perform document analysis of 2 different documents and create their frequency table (vectors) for words common in both documents. Write logic to highly most important words present in both of documents*

*Bonus*
- Write a `stop word removal` logic
- Write logic for `Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency`

## About Data

### Description

The data that I have used in this assessment is taken from two of my favourite books from my childhood:

1. The Great Expectation by Charles Dickens
2. Treasure Island by Robert Louise Stevenson

The excerpts from these 2 sources will mimic real-word analysis and foster more insights rather than working on

### Nature of Data

## Why I think I deserve full marks?

1. Real world data rather than some dummy texts
2. Use of `poetry` for virtualisation and code management.
3. Writing util functions used here like `stop word removal` from scratch
4. Optimised algorithm for finding uniqe words between 2 documents
5. No libraries
6. Using memoising/caching.
7. Performed data cleaning at basic text level
8. Used self-developed util functions
